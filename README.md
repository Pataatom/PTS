This is my take to create a simple RTS game where you need to gather resources, build buildings and defenses, etc.

I started in early July of 2023; it is still work in progress. I take a lot of breaks, so it will take some time until it is done, if ever.

I draw all the things that I use, so it doesn't always look perfect, but I like how it looks so far.

(PTS stands for Programming Time Strategy, which I thought was a fun idea until I realized how much time it would take to implement programming into a control of unit.)

Also, English is my second language, so I am sorry for the mistakes that I made in the comments or this README.
